##PATTERNS PROJECT

This is simple project used to practice and learn some of the main design patterns.

The basis are extracted from the book [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.es/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Freeman/dp/0596007124).

##SET UP

    composer install
    
##CODING AND TESTING

As there are many patterns, it should be a directory for each pattern. This way, you can find every thing you want easily.

The structure is simple:

 - **src**: Basic folder with all design patterns implementations
 - **tests**: Folder with all test to execute every design pattern
